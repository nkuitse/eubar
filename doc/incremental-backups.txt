Incremental backups
===================

eubar -r ARCHIVE can be used to perform a referential (a.k.a. differential or
incremental) backup using any previous backup as a reference point.

First, do a full backup to a new archive:

    eubar -a FULL -e find /foo

Then create an archive with only changed or added files:

    eubar -a INCR -r FULL -e find /foo

Here, eubar reads metadata from the reference backup, printing differential
data and metadata to INCR.eud and INCR.eum, respectively.  You can use -R
instead of -r ARCHIVE to read reference metadata from standard input, which
comes in handy when backing up to a remote server.

For example, if you store data and metadata in compressed form on the server:

    gunzip < INCR.eum.gz |
    ssh CLIENT1 eubar -R -e find /foo 2> >(gzip > INCR.eum.gz) |
    gzip > FULL.eud.gz
