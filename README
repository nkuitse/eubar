eubar
=====

eubar et al. are a suite of simple tools for archiving files, with file
contents (by default) stored in one file and file metadata (including
references to their contents) in another.

eubar is unusual in several regards.

First, you must tell it exactly which files to archive; it doesn't perform any
kind of directory traversal, file filtering, etc.

Second, eubar itself doesn't have any file extraction capability; you must use
the accompanying eubcat program (currently a Perl script) to extract the
contents of a single file or eubotar to create a tar archive.

libtar (for tar file generation) and libb2 (for BLAKE2b hashing) are
prerequisites.
